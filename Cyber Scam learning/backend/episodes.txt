This is Darknet Diaries, true stories from the dark side of the internet. In this episode we’re going to test the physical security of a bank. The goal isn’t to steal cash but to get access to the teller’s computer. Jason is one of those guys who has endless stories of incredible things that have happened to him. Heâs also a Diet Pepsi addict. When you talk to him you hear him say random things like: "I almost died peeing off a cliff in Bulgaria" Jason started out in law enforcement but for almost the last twenty years he’s been working in InfoSec. One of his favorite things to do is what he calls Security Awareness Engagement. Companies hire Jason to actually test if this kind of thing is possible. When I do these engagements theyâre not red team engagements.  Theyâ�ais’re literally security awareness engagements. I try to get caught by the end of the engagement because I’m trying to teach the employees how to be better. CNN.com's John Sutter traveled to the Middle East to test the physical security of a bank in Beirut, Lebanon. The stories he heard were all captured by his wrist camera, a button camera on his jacket, or closed-captioned cameras in the bank itself.

Bellini gets a user ID, a password, a smart card, a computer, and network access. Jason doesn’t like to do a lot of recon before a mission like this. If he’s working with another person on the mission and they start planning and plotting and prepping for the break-in, Jason will just sayâ¦ “I just walk in and be adorable” Jason uses a USB rubber ducky as a pwn plug. He also uses a Proxmark3 tool, Dropboxes, and other malicious tools. He says he's not trying to get a red team, he's just trying to educate people about the dangers. JASON: I go to the first branch and I literally just walk in. I walk past the executive.  I walk to this managerâs office where he’s talking to someone. He doesn’t see me look in so I pause right outside his door. I wait there for about thirty seconds. [MUSIC] Then I walked from there straight into the executiveâs office.  Her first impression has gotta be that I just finished talking to the manager.  I tell her that yeah, Iâ�aim here with the auditor.  Weâre doing an audit on the computer systems from head office.  Rubber ducky can be configured to create a remote control session to a computer. By plugging it into a computer for only a few seconds it can give a hacker full control of that machine from a remote location. JASON: I go to this other lady thatâs beside the teller line. She made eye contact with me as I left so I stayed straight-on eye contact. I tell her hey, look, I’m doing an audit on the machines from head office. I need to go through all these machines. Got her to let me compromise her machine. At one point he was only a couple feet away from the teller line. He then took control of the computer and started using it. He also used other electronic devices like scanners, printers and monitors. JASON: One of the executives that was there watching this go down actually wanted me at one point to go and steal the money because I was getting everything. He was depositing $250,000 in cash. I could have reached out and touched it. The manager asked Jason to take a look at a computer problem. Jason said in order to help heâs going to need a user ID, a password, and a smart card. Jason looked at the problem for a minute and said he’ll just replace that computer with a new one. Jason was allowed to go to the vault, but not to use the phone lines or jacks. He got the user ID, the password, and the smart card from one of the main supervisors. He successfully got three of the things. I literally left the branch about three times. The branch was so horrible on their response, I literally waited in there until the whole branch was closed for the day and then I had everybody come around and had the executive that was with me actually translate everything into Arabic. Thatâs when they became aware that I was a bad guy. The bank manager was still confused about who Jason was. The next day Jason meets up with his driver to take him to the next branch. Jason has two objectives left; to steal a computer and to get network access. The driver drops him off outside the bank. JASON: The sign on the door said something in French and Arabic. The sign had an arrow and Iâm like, I have no idea what that means. JASON: I go back to the original door and I push the button. Jason is known for giving awkward hugs but if he would have gone into the wrong bank and tried to steal a computer from it, this would have been a whole new level of awkwardness that he would not have been prepared for. Luckily his [00:15:00] driver caught him before entering the wrongBank. He reset himself and went into the right bank. JASON: I felt bad about all the stuff I did in the first one so I vowed not to talk to anybody. I just walked back, found the break room, got a little bit of water so that way, after a couple of minutes, I’m now approaching from a different direction. I literally go up to the â beside the teller that’s actually conducting business beside me and without even saying a word to him I start unplugging the computer. Unplug it, disconnect everything, and I walk out with it. Jason has four of the five objectives complete and has one branch left. The last objective is to get network access. The driver takes Jason to the last branch. He walks up to a lady cleaning offices and tells her he needs to get into the network halls. Jason had easily broken into three banks in three days and completed all five of his objectives. He met back up with the executives that hired him and they were flabbergasted. Of course he has to have a Diet Pepsi while he tells the story. I was hired to rob a bank there for this one bank. We were going one off-script to a branch that they didn’t know about. I’d already drunk a 1.5 litre bottle of Diet Pepsi already which usually leads me to problems. I had to go really bad. "I know that the bathrooms in Europe and a lot of other countries, theyâre either on the second floor or in the basement," he says. "But I couldn’t find one.  I see the branch.  It’s got tellers, itâ�ais the bank I’m supposed to go into" "I compromise all the employees and then I go back and I talk to all the employee and tell them what I did and what they did wrong," he says. "The security awareness engagement, the success is plugging it into one device âcause one device is all it takes to compromise the network" Microsoft employee was doing a USB audit of a bank when he received a forged e-mail from the CFO of the bank. The bank's CFO is also the daughter of the owner of the company. The e-mails were sent on an iPad to make it look like it was from the bank's owner's daughter. "Thereâs a third option.  This third option was not known to me or even conceived in me for a very long time, because I had just never â�ai it just never crossed my mind," he says. "I just looked at her dead in the eyes and said like, this is unfortunate.  Yeah, I got nothing.  I should not be here" "I plugged the USB drive into the bank managerâs computer, which I thought at the time was a very good idea," he says. "It popped up the notepad.  It showed that this is all it said" "I literally even got to the point where I was just like, you can Google me" "I was in the back room compromising everything there," he says. "I was able to start talking to them in Arabic and English and French" "They speak all three languages fluently. Theyâre very unhappy" Jason is escorted by car to the headquarters of a bank that he accidentally broke into. He was starting to get pretty worried. "I literally, legit technically did bad things," he says. “I’m not going to lie to you,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve ever done anything like this.” “It’s not like I was trying to hurt anyone,’’ he said, “it was just like I wanted to make a point.’ Jason Priestley says he and his co-hosts were allowed to walk around unescorted into areas they shouldnât have. They were able to Google rubber ducky and find out it was a testing tool. "I actually spent at least two of the hours giving them educational training, consulting with them on all the things they did wrong," he says. "I did not breathe a good sigh of relief until I was on a plane to Paris like, three days later" Before leaving Beirut, Jason did find the right bank and successfully broke into it and gained access to all the computers in the first branch. In fact, that break-in was documented by National Geographic for an episode of a show called Breakthrough. Be wary of certain e-mails that look like they’re coming from â that have a link and an attachment. Never let someone follow you in with your ID and badge, using your access to get into the building. This is a security policy. Darknet Diaries is a weekly, offbeat look at the world of the internet. This week, Jason shares his story of living on the internet with the world. Jason: We win by informing and giving knowledge to others.

Jack got banned from playing EverQuest in 2002. After years of doing the same repetitive things over and over and making it to the top, he got bored and quit. But that didn't last long because he found himself playing again a few weeks later. The world will become altered in ways youâve never expected. There will be massive amounts of gold and wealth, so gather around and listen to a tale of epic proportions. This tale is so crazy that it was featured in Wired Magazine. This is Darknet Diaries, true stories from the dark side of the internet. Manfred has kept his story quiet for twenty years. He first spoke about this at Defcon, the largest hacker conference in the world. Manfred was going to show two zero-day exploits in a couple of games. But his Defcon talk got taken down due to a copyright claim by ArenaNet, the makers of Guild Wars 2. Manfred was originally known as Phuckchop in Ultima Online. The name added insults to injury to the players that he player-killed, Manfred says. Manfred: "I did it all in good fun. It was just a game" Manfred has been playing MMORPGs ever since. He is an expert at finding bugs in MMOs. The exploit he finds in almost every game is an integer overflow. He captures the packets and analyzes whatâs in them. Computers have a limit of how high they can count. Video games don’t always check if you can subtract from the lowest amounts. Manfred tries to subtract from zero and he sometimes gets surprising results. World of Warcraft was leading the pack as the most popular MMORPG in 2007. Manfred: Ultima Online, Dark Age of Camelot, Anarchy Online, Lineage II, Final Fantasy Online, the first one, World of Warcraft, RIFT Online, Elder Scrolls Online, Lord of the Rings Online. Jack: I think it had close to ten million players. Manfred became curious what packets the computer was sending to the server when he would use a talent point. The packets between his computer and the server were encrypted so he couldn’t see what was inside them. But he’s a reverse-engineer, so he starts to tinker with the game client. JACK: Once he has his hooks in the game communication, he played the game and spent a talent point to boost his character. He tried replaying that same packet back to the game client. What he was expecting to see was that he had spent one talent point and his talent would go up. Manfred found a way to spend talent points without using talent points, and to spend more than five. Talent points are rare and you can only get a certain amount. You can only spend a maximum of five on a specific skill. Manfred: I log into the game and I still have my whatever, fifteen points in my talent tree. JACK: Manfred overloaded his talents with this exploit, he became god-like in the game. He started decking out his character in all the best equipment and made himself even more powerful. Manfred:	I was able to boost it up to fifteen points using only five points. Manfred was able to easily clear dungeons that normally takes five people to complete. He kept pushing his abilities to see what was possible to do with this super character. At one point his goal became Molten Core. This was a raid-level dungeon which required forty people to clear. He found there were debug packets that were enabled in production servers. After spending time analyzing the debug packets he found ways of doing some amazing things. He eventually started getting bored with the game and decided to see how far he can push this before getting banned. We started going out into the PVP lands and just basically one-shotting people, killing the person, like a super buffed-up Level 80 person or Level 50, whatever the level cap was back then, in a single hit or a couple of hits. The players would start complaining. Theyâd take screen shots, they’d call GMs, and fairly quickly, maybe one or two weeks, maybe three weeks afterwards, we all get banned. Manfred was banned from World of Warcraft, but could move on to another game. A few years before that, he played a game called Shadowbane. Manfred was amazed at how buggy this game was. He concluded the game must have skipped any Alpha testing, any Beta testing, and went directly to final release. I think Shadowbane deserves its own category and maybe a movie made after it. Shadowbane was so hopelessly insecure that if I were to write a game to demonstrate the game developers, no, do not write the game like this âcause this is very insecure. I’d basically give them Shadowbane. Manfred got bored and started reverse-engineering the client. He found that there was no server side validation for any packet he sent. He could open up other playersâ bank vaults, take items from them, load any piece of equipment into his inventory. He tried to see if anyone would be willing to buy equipment, gold, or characters from him for real dollars. He decided the game was so buggy and he didnât want to play it anymore. We just decided to do a grand finale hack and basically uninstall the game and move on. I knew if we made this super obvious that servers would get rolled back. One of our grand finale acts was to basically teleport high-level monsters into safe haven cities that new players would start in. "We teleported like Level 200 monsters in there to kill anybody that joined the game. We teleported an entire town full of people under the ocean" "Weâre killing newbies joining in the game, weâ�ais killing active players, we’re teleporting players into the ocean." Manfred decided to make every safe zone in the game a PVP zone. This means the players could attack other players anywhere in the world. Manfred had used his exploits to level his character high up and gave his character all the best equipment. Manfred's chaos impacted everyone on the entire server. After about an hour of total chaos the servers went offline. He and his friends were banned from the game and the server rolled back to a save point before the chaos began. The Shadowbane hack was so ridiculous that Wired wrote an article about it back in 2003 when it happened. Nobody ever knew who was behind this until now. Wired posted a comment from the game developers which said, quote, âre working with law enforcement. Manfred was never contacted by game developers or law enforcement for this event. Manfred has tried working with game developers to responsibly disclose the bugs he finds in the game. The game was not compromised and we were just using the game protocol. Manfred says he's tried to work with game developers but it's always backfired. He says the game industry doesn't want to deal with people responsibly disclosing hacks. Manfred: "Youâve got to assume maybe the gameindustry doesn’t want to work" This year Manfred gave a talk at Defcon. He was going to expose two unfixed bugs in Elder Scrolls Online and WildStar Online. He decided not to demonstrate the hack. The opposite happened. They just said weâre gonna ban you. After Defcon, one of the companies that was behind Elder Scrolls Online came up to me. I showed them the exploit shortly after Defcon. While we were still in Vegas I showed it to them in person. The other one for WildStar Online, I sent him an e-mail describing the issue at hand. Manfred found ways to turn virtual items into real US dollars. No longer was this about fun and games, it became a serious full-time business. Join us in Part 2 of this story as we shift from putting coins into the game to taking coins out of the game. Darknet Diaries is a weekly, offbeat look at what's going on in the internet world. This week, Manfred takes a look at some of the stories he's been reading about.

episode - 8:
This is Part 2 of a two part series on Manfred. If you want to hear how he hacks online games for fun, check out Part 1 first. The first hack he ever did was on a game called Sim City. This is Darknet Diaries, true stories from the dark side of the internet. In this episode we pick back up with Manfred. What if you could hack the money system in a massive multiplayer online game? In the late 90s Manfred first started making money hacking online games. The game he was playing at that time was Ultima Online. Manfred got good at it, and then got bored, so he started tinkering and reverse-engineering the client. Manfred was trying to find out how the process of demolishing your own house worked. He was curious to see how that worked at the protocol level. Manfred: "What was the client sending to the server to cause the house deletion event to happen?" "I was like huh, maybe they fixed it. Maybe server sites are checking if Iâm the owner of the house or not" "I tried it once more just to make sure.  I opened up my house menu and I sent the deletion packet and it deleted my house" The server doesn’t check if you’re the owner of this house when you send the delete packet. The thing that it wants is it wants you to make sure that you have a house menu dialog up when youâre interacting with the house. I think initially I started deleting players’ homes of rival guilds [DEMOLISH SOUNDS] âcause it was a game censored around PVP. When Manfred would delete another playerâs house, the deed to that house would show up in his inventory. Not only was he able to collect all the items that were stored in that house but he would also essentially take ownership of that house. Houses were selling for hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars depending on the size of the house. Usually most players had a house that was just a single room. The largest house was a castle, which was huge to accommodate a guild and their items. "I could go in, delete this house, place my house on top of it without anybody suspecting anything" "I look around, thereâs nobody around so I run the exploit, collapse their tower and place three small houses in its place" "I was on the newbie character. I was Level 1. I had nothing on me, just a t-shirt and some torn pants so I was like, I don’t know what’s going on" "I was kind of afraid that a GM would pop in and theyâd see that I had deleted this house and placed these three in place of it" I was pretty nervous âcause this turned into a pretty good business model. I kind of felt sorry for the GM after a few minutes I could tell that the GM had no idea what was going on. Five minutes in, he has no answer and the GM tools weren’t mature enough. "It was either GMs or hackers. They were accusing the GM of deleting the house, or hackers" "I knew I was off the hook for getting banned in a game that exploit fixed right there and there" "For all the GM knew, maybe they were totally fabricating the story" Manfred found a bug that gave him the ability to build a house underground. The GM reported it to the developers and the game company fired the GM. Manfred and his friends got banned. Manfred was just trying to help the game developers by reporting these bugs. Manfred waited until late Sunday night when GMs and developers were asleep and created a new character. He ran around the game deleting every house he could find. He logged off for the last time and never returned. Manfred found a bug in Ultima Online that made selling houses impossible. The developers apologized to players for the roll back. Manfred then found an amazing bug in another game that allowed him to exploit the game even more. A glitch in Dark Age of Camelot allows players to log in twice. The glitch is called a dupe glitch where you duplicate items, or in this case, I duplicate my entire character. In-game, if you were to look at me, you’d see two copies of the same character standing. The ability to duplicate in-game gold alone is a jackpot. Even if he started with one gold coin, if he duplicated it twenty times heâd have over one million gold. He possess the ability to make as much gold as he wants. "I started selling Dark Age of Camelot platinum and items on eBay" "I think around 2003 or 2004 eBay banned the sale of virtual goods using their platform" "It created this huge black market economy on the internet for virtual goods" Using a duplication bug in the game, Manfred is able to create an unlimited amount of in-game gold. He then sells this gold to players who are paying real US dollars for it. By using the bug he found, he could single-handedly meet all market demand. Asheron used an exploit that would allow him to move all his items to a friend. This gave him the ability to duplicate anything he had, including gold. He found an integer overflow bug that allowed him to subtract his strength beyond zero, giving him 65,000 strength points. He could withdraw negative platinum from the guild bank which would result in positive platinum in his inventory, allowing him to create as much gold as he wanted out of thin air. He could sell a rock to a vendor but say it was a diamond and the vendor would buy rocks at diamond prices. One allowed him to split stacks of items like potions and conduct an integer overflow during the split, like trying to take negative one potion from the stack. This resulted in him getting two billion potions. If you were to take all the WildStar Online platinum that Manfred had and sell it for real money in today’s market value, Manfred would have 397 trillion US dollars. Of course, there isn’t enough market demand for him to sell that much platinum. He was only able to sell to people who were willing to buy in-game platinum. Manfred is the guy who sold popcorn outside the movie theatre. The popcorn seller isn't competing with the theatre in any way. The movie theatre saw how much the popcorn seller was making and couldn’t keep the popcorn outside. They decided to start selling it themselves. Manfred would only sell gold to players for games that weren’t already doing that themselves. He thinks it would be unethical to compete with game companies that sell gold. Some game companies have stopped charging entirely for their game. A lot of the Chinese and Russian hackers that are involved with this, and thereâs a lot of them, they hack in the way that’s completely black-hat and completely unethical. They don’t care about compromising servers. They’ll send malware to people that play the game just so they could install a key logger and steal their game credentials. Fan sites for World of Warcraft often run by Chinese or Russians. Main reason is people tend to re-use their e-mail addresses and passwords. If you log into a fan site, chances are pretty good that same username and password youâre using for that fan site will also work on your world of Warcraft account. This is the most unethical way of getting in-game gold. Denial of service attack game companies game servers in retaliation. They’ll try and root through systems to get ahold of the databases, which happened to Guild Wars II and probably a lot of other games. Itâs the Wild West, it’s a multi-billion dollar industry. A lot of hackers out there that don’t care. In 2011 hackers that were sponsored by North Korea and Kim Jong-Il were caught hacking into the Lineage video game servers. The story says they were doing it to raise money for North Korea. This is the only time I’ve ever heard of a nation state sponsoring a hack against a video game company. Manfred did not believe he broke any laws doing what he did. Yes, it was against the game rules and if he was caught he was banned. At one point he was even sent a cease and desist letter. The way game companies look at security, they frown upon people modding their clients, people reverse-engineering, but I think they really should take a step back and try and work with hackers in the community to help secure their games. Over the past twenty years, every single game has integer overflow and that’s something that really shouldn’t happen. WildStar Online had extremely simple exploits in that game. Most of these bugs or exploits could be identified and fixed within a week. A lot of companies today offer bounty rewards for people who find bugs. Not very many game companies are doing this yet. The game companies are moving into providing the sale of virtual goods directly through their in-game interface mechanics. This is really going from a gray area to almost illegal but it would be unethical for me to go in and undermine a companyâs in-app purchase business model. Manfred has been able to support himself solely through exploiting online video games. Now Manfred works for a security assessment company and has gone completely white-hat. Even though he thinks itâs unethical to compete with companies who have in-app purchases, there are still many other hackers. Darknet Diaries is a weekly, offbeat look at what's going on in the internet world. This week, Manfred takes a look at some of the stories he's been reading about.

episode - 9:
The CEO of Mt. Gox has released a statement for the first time since the Bitcoin exchange was shut down. This, amid speculation that the CEO was in hiding following reports that an estimated 744,000 Bitcoins, worth about 350 million dollars, was stolen. Japanese authorities are currently said to be investigating the matter. Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic currency. Instead of there being a big data center that handles all the transactions, in Bitcoin world the transactions are done by crowdsourcing. Anyone can join in on processing Bitcoin transactions. But why should they? Bitcoin is digital money and you can buy it through an exchange. Itâs not tied to any particular country, it’s anonymous, and all transactions and Bitcoin are public information. When someone gives Bitcoin to another person, anyone can see that that money was moved. In 2010 a web programmer named Jed McCaleb took an interest in Bitcoin. He had an old domain lying around called mtgox.com which initially stood for Magic the Gathering Online Exchange. Even when there were multiple other exchanges, Mt. Gox was still processing 70 percent of all Bitcoin. You could buy Bitcoin with US dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds, Russian rubles. Mt. Gox was the go-to place if you wanted to buy or sell Bitcoin. But all that came to a screeching halt in 2014. Investigators, police, government agencies, they just don’t have the resources to investigate. Kim Nilsson is a general software consultant. He works with software development mostly, but he also does blockchain analysis. There are over [00:05:00] 300,000 transactions a day and each one of these is stored in a way that anyone can view them. I was pretty much a Mt. Gox customer, yes. I was just using them for trading and whatnot. I wasnât really actively observing them while they were up or anything. I felt like someone needs to investigate this and I wasn’t prepared to trust that normal law enforcement would investigate it properly. "I joined forces a little bit with some other guys and cooperated when necessary and we tried to get a hold of as much data as we could to try to figure it out," he said. "After that itâs basically just been me plowing through that and doing technical analysis" Kim has been studying the blockchain and trying to piece together what happened to Mt. Gox. The data containing all these transactions is almost 40 gigabytes and there were hundreds of millions of records. He spent a long time crunching this data and found brilliant ways of searching it faster. Mt. Gox was founded, or reworked, as a Bitcoin exchange in 2010. It was likely ran by a single person at the time, Jed McCaleb. McCaleb was a web developer and personally created the site from scratch. Jed McCaleb and Mark KarpelÃ¨s started talking. Jed was realizing the site required more time than he could put into it. Mark showed an interest in taking over Mt. Gox from Jed. Mt. Gox almost gave it away to Mark KarpelÃ¨s in that very favorable price and sold it for almost no upfront money and just getting a cut of the revenue for the next six months, I think. But just before the transfer of ownership to Mark, something terrible happened. Someone had broken into the Mt Gox servers and stole the hot wallet file. The hot wallet is a Bitcoin wallet used to conduct daily operational trades. Mt. Gox was technically already insolvent as soon as Mark KarpelÃ¨s took it over. 80,000 Bitcoins that disappeared and are still sitting untouched on the blockchain to this day. Mark KarpelÃ¨s is now running Mt. Gox from Tokyo, Japan. All ownership is now transferred to him and a few months go by under his management. Mark was in the process of figuring out where the Mt.Gox Bitcoins should be kept. Mark was keeping 300,000 Bitcoins from Mt. Gox on his own unsecured machine. A thief was just poking around, got lucky, and found it and ran away with it. The thief offered to give all the Bitcoins back in exchange for a small keeperâs fee. JACK: I donât think it was some master hacker. It was probably just someone poking around, like I said. KIM: Probably, if I were to venture a guess, they offered to give the coins back. At some point someone again got into Mt. Gox’s system. They were probably able to take a small database dump of the userâs table. Whoever got into this made good use of this little feature. The hacker was creating Bitcoin out of thin air and selling them as fast as they could. Bitcoin was worth around 17 dollars at the time. This hacker sold so many Bitcoins it drove the price all the way down to one cent each. Then the thief bought back the cheap Bitcoin and tried to move the Bitcoin to another address. Mark KarpelÃ¨s saw this crash happening and shut the servers down. Mt. Gox was able to get some Bitcoins out by inflating balances, trading them for a bit, and just trying to withdraw. They got about two thousand Bitcoins out that way. A couple more months go by and Mark is looking to expand Mt. G Rox to be able to do business in Europe. In late summer 2011 there was this other exchange in Poland called Bitomat that accidentally destroyed their own Bitcoin holdings. That destroyed 17,000 Bitcoins. Mt. Gox was sort of looking to [00:15:00]expand and have local licenses and whatnot to operate in local markets. Mark had only been running Mt. Gox for about five months and is already missing $50,000 in cash and a massive 100,000 Bitcoin. While Markâs skillset was mostly in programming, he believed Mt.Gox could be turned around and become a very profitable company. Someone seems to have gotten into the system. They have access to the database. Probably by the best estimates, something short of 80,000 Bitcoins was taken out of Mt. Gox. Because of that, this incident is a bit harder to track. Mt. Gox is now missing almost 200,000 Bitcoins. The theft went on until at least a good chunk into 2013. By the time it was finally detected and stopped, the thief had been able to siphon 650,000 dollars. There simply wasnât a technology out there to encrypt Bitcoin wallets at the time. You might also wonder why Mt. Gox was target for so many attacks. A few weeks after the theft, Bitcoin wallets were released with the feature to encrypt. Bitcoin is basically incentivized hacking in that now that you have things like crypto-currency you can actually steal actual money just by hacking computers. Mt. Gox had the â it was a double-edge sword in that it pioneered a lot of the markets but also since it was the first. Mark KarpelÃ¨s deployed a new wallet system into Mt. Gox that he had programmed himself in an attempt to have a more secure service. But near the end of 2011 his newwallet system had a programming error. It was misidentifying transactions as putting new Bitcoins into user accounts. This is an instance where he actually had a bug in his code. That meant that a number of withdrawals actually sent Bitcoins to unspendable addresses. That lost about 2,500 Bitcoins that became destroyed because of this. Mt. Gox didn’t have any more thefts or break-ins since the new wallet software was added. It seems like his improved security was working. But Mark knew he was missing so many Bitcoins. He tried to keep all these breaches and thefts under wraps. By mid 2013 Mt. Gox was handling 70 percent of the world’s Bitcoin trades. Even though it was the leader of Bitcoin exchanges there weren’t that many employees. Mark did a lot of the programming himself. In 2013 Mt. Gox wanted to expand into the US so it agreed to use a company called CoinLab to handle all North American transactions. CoinLab was seeking 75 million dollars and they kept the five million dollars that Mt Gox gave them. Later in the summer of 2013 the US Department of Homeland Security issued a warrant to seize money from Mt.Gox. They had been in violation of acting as an unregistered money transmitter. Jared Jack: I don’t know who had the original idea. There was an e-mail leaked where Mark and Jed is discussing it. Jed is suggesting that maybe you can make trades on your own exchange to shift this liability back and forth. The way Mark had implanted this internal trading mechanism, it actually kept all the logs so itâs possible to get quite accurate information of what work was done or not. He didn’t seem to wipe any logs or anything like that. Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange on the market, shut down entirely. The website went offline and simply returned a blank page. Protests began outside the Tokyo office. At the end of February Mt.Gox had filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo, stating they had lost 850,000 Bitcoins. Mark KarpelÃ¨s was arrested in August 2013 for embezzlement and fraud. He is accused of falsely adding Bitcoins into the accounts of investors. He has continued to plead innocent to these charges. Alex Vinnik was arrested for money laundering but evidence shows that he had some of the Bitcoins that were stolen from Mt. Gox. Mark KarpelÃ¨s was released on bail and is currently residing in Tokyo. Since 2014 when Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed. Those 200,000 Bitcoins he found have sat untouched since he found them. If he were to pay off all his creditors today, he may then get to walk away with over one billion dollars. The industry and the community has learned a lot since Mt. Gox. There was no real best practices back in 2011 or anything like that. It can be really hard to keep up with actually investing the time needed to keep your technology up to date. It’s not a good idea to leave your Bitcoin on the exchange unless you’re actually trading it. For long-term storage itâs best to keep a Bitcoin wallet on your own computer. A lot of lessons can be learned from Mt. Gox. Youâve been listening to Darknet Diaries. For show notes and links, check out darknetdiaries.com. Music is provided by Podington Bear.
